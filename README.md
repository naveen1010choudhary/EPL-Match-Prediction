# âš½ EPL Match Outcome Prediction

This is a data science project that uses machine learning to predict the outcome (Win, Loss, or Draw) of English Premier League matches. The model is built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, with all analysis contained in the main Jupyter Notebook.

### Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Scikit-learn (sklearn):** For feature engineering and building the predictive model.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For data visualization.

### Project Workflow

My process for this project followed these key steps:

1.  **Data Collection:** The dataset (`epl-data.csv`) was sourced from [mention where you got it - e.g., Kaggle, football-data.co.uk, etc.]. It includes match statistics from the X to Y seasons.

2.  **Data Cleaning:** I handled missing values and converted data types. For example, I [mention one specific cleaning task you did, e.g., "encoded team names into numerical values"].

3.  **Feature Engineering:** This was the most critical step. I created new features that I believed would influence a match's outcome, such as:
    * **Team Form:** Points accumulated over the last 5 matches.
    * **Home/Away Advantage:** Separate statistics for home and away performance.
    * **Goal Difference:** Average goals scored vs. conceded.

4.  **Modeling:**
    * I tested several classification models, including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.
    * I split the data into a training set and a testing set to evaluate performance.

5.  **Evaluation:** The final model, [Your Best Model, e.g., Random Forest], achieved an accuracy of **[Your Accuracy, e.g., 58%]** on the unseen test data.
